# Maven Toys Portfolio

## Project Background
Maven Toys is a leading retail chain of toy stores with a strong presence across Mexico. Operating over 50 physical stores in key metropolitan and suburban areas, the company has also established a growing online shopping platform to expand its reach. 

Known for its wide variety of high-quality toys, Maven Toys caters to a diverse customer base, from children to adult collectors. Its product lineup includes educational toys, popular licensed merchandise, and more, reflecting its commitment to meeting varying customer needs. Despite its success, Maven Toys faces challenges in inventory management, sales forecasting, and profitability optimization. To address these, the company has undertaken a detailed analysis of its sales and inventory data from 2017 and 2018.

Key aspects of the analysis include:
  - Sales Performance: Understanding store-level contributions, product-level trends, and overall sales growth.
  - Profitability: Identifying high-margin products and profitable categories.
  - Seasonal Trends: Pinpointing peak sales periods and aligning inventory strategies accordingly.
  - Inventory Management: Addressing stockout issues and slow-moving inventory to improve capital efficiency.
  - Operational Optimization: Leveraging insights to streamline procurement, marketing, and store operations.

## Insight Deep Dive: Portfolio Project - Sales and Profit Analysis
This provides a comprehensive analysis of key sales and profit metrics across various product categories, locations, and product-specific performance. This deep dive explores important patterns, correlations, and opportunities for optimization.

**1. Product Category Performance**
The Toys category stands out as the highest gross profit contributor across all locations. With a gross profit of $630,029 in Downtown, it consistently outperforms other categories in all regions, suggesting that Toys are highly demanded. This is further confirmed by the strong sales volume of products like Lego Bricks, which is the top-selling product across the board.

Electronics and Art & Crafts follow closely in terms of gross profit, with Downtown locations being the most profitable.
Sports & Outdoors category, while profitable, shows the least gross profit across all locations, with the lowest being in the Airport region at $39,393.
This indicates that while Toys dominate in sales and profitability, Electronics and Games also perform well in specific locations, making them a strategic focus for targeted marketing and inventory allocation.

**2. Sales Trends by Location**
A closer look at sales trends across locations reveals that Downtown locations generate the highest sales and gross profit. This is consistent across nearly all product categories. In contrast, Airport locations show weaker sales and profits, which could be attributed to factors like limited foot traffic or less targeted consumer segments.

Top Performing Locations:

Toys and Electronics dominate in Downtown locations, with Toys Downtown leading with a gross profit of $630,029.
Electronics Downtown follows closely with $502,490.
Underperforming Locations:

Airport locations consistently underperform across categories, with Sports & Outdoors in Airport contributing the least at $39,393 in gross profit.
This points to the need for targeted promotions or product-specific strategies in lower-performing locations, particularly Airports, to boost sales and profitability.

**3. Product Performance Insights**
Top 5 Profitable Products:

Lego Bricks leads the product list with a total sales amount of $2,388,883, solidifying its position as a strong revenue generator.
Colorbuds follows with $1,564,476, demonstrating a consistent demand across various locations.
Interestingly, Magic Sand and Action Figures also show strong profitability, with Magic Sand at $968,962 and Action Figures at $926,748, indicating a trend towards products that engage kids in creative play.

Sales-to-Inventory Ratios:

Products like Playfoam, Hot Wheels 5-Pack, and Jenga exhibit strong sales-to-inventory ratios (0.2, 0.15, and 0.15, respectively), which signifies efficient inventory management and quick turnover.
Conversely, products like Deck of Cards (0.02) and Dinosaur Figures (0.03) show a need for either markdowns or promotional strategies to move excess inventory.
By optimizing inventory levels and focusing on the most profitable products with high sales-to-inventory ratios, Maven Toys can further improve profitability and reduce stockholding costs.

**4. Strategic Recommendations**
Maximize Downtown Potential: Given the strong performance of locations like Downtown, Maven Toys should consider focusing marketing campaigns and exclusive product offerings in these areas.
Airport Locations Need Focus: Efforts should be made to increase foot traffic and optimize product assortments in Airport locations, where sales are comparatively lower.
Product and Category Focus: The company should continue pushing Toys and Electronics, particularly in locations like Downtown, while also addressing the underperformance of Sports & Outdoors and Games in certain areas.
By aligning inventory with regional sales performance, Maven Toys can ensure better profitability across all locations.


## 5. Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are proposed:

**1. Focus on High-Performing Product Categories**
Toys: Prioritize high-demand products like Lego Bricks and Colorbuds in key locations, particularly Downtown and Commercial.
Electronics: Continue promoting high-margin products like Magic Sand and Rubik’s Cube in Downtown locations.

**2. Improve Performance in Underperforming Locations**
Airport Locations: Introduce impulse-buy products and bundles to boost sales in Airport stores.
Residential & Commercial Locations: Run targeted promotions, especially in Commercial locations where there’s potential for growth.

**3. Optimize Inventory Management**
High Sales-to-Inventory Products: Increase inventory of efficient products like Playfoam and Hot Wheels 5-Pack.
Slow-Moving Products: Bundle low-sales products like Deck of Cards to drive purchases.

**4. Enhance Regional Targeting and Marketing**
Downtown: Boost marketing campaigns in Downtown to capitalize on strong sales.
Low-Performing Areas: Tailor marketing for Airport and Residential areas with location-specific promotions.

**5. Monitor Profitability and Customer Preferences Regularly**
Profitability Tracking: Review sales and inventory turnover regularly for adjustments.
Customer Preferences: Analyze trends and adjust product offerings based on customer feedback.
